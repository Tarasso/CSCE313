# PA0

Blank A: "#include <vector>"
Blank B: "public:"

Dot operators switched to arrows since working with pointers

added "std::" to std dependent functions such as vector, cout, endl

Blank C: initalize each NULL value in the vector to a new node object

line 20: upper bound changed to node_num - 1 bc last node next value should remain NULL

Blank D: for loop to delete nodes created on heap to fix memory leak
